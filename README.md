![AWS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Built%20with-AWS-orange?style=flat&logo=amazonaws)![Project Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-finished-green)

This project demonstrates how to build an Amazon Lex chatbot with a single intent: **Book an Appointment**. The bot collects information such as date, time, and type of appointment using conversational AI. Once all required slots are filled, it confirms the booking or passes the data to a Lambda function for processing.

- Language: English (US)

- Children-directed: No

- Sentiment analysis: Off (you can enable it later if needed)

- Idle session timeout: 5 minutes (default is fine)

- Click Next

**C. Add an Intent**
- Click **‚ÄúAdd intent‚Äù** ‚Üí choose **‚ÄúCreate intent‚Äù**

- **Intent name**: ``BookAppointment``

- Save it for now ‚Äî we‚Äôll define slots and utterances in the next step.

## Step 2: Define Slots and Sample Utterances
#### üó£Ô∏è A. Sample Utterances
- In the BookAppointment intent, add a few training phrases (utterances) to teach Lex what users might say:
  
``I want to book an appointment``

``Schedule an appointment for {Date} at {Time}``

`` Book a {AppointmentType} appointment on {Date}``

``I need to see a {AppointmentType} at {Time}``

``Can I get a {AppointmentType} appointment tomorrow?``

**B. Define Slots**
You'll add three slots: ``AppointmentType, Date, and Time.``

1. ``AppointmentType``
   
- Slot name: ``AppointmentType``

- Slot type: Custom (create a slot type)

   - Click "Add slot type"

   - Name: ``AppointmentTypeValues``

   - Values: Doctor, Dentist, Therapist, Interview, Haircut

- Prompt: ‚ÄúWhat type of appointment would you like to book?‚Äù

2. ``Date``
  - Slot name: ``Date``

  - Slot type: ``AMAZON.Date``

  - Prompt: ‚ÄúOn what date do you want the appointment?‚Äù

 3. ``Time``
   - Slot name: ``Time``

   - Slot type: ``AMAZON.Time``

   - Prompt: ‚ÄúWhat time works best for your appointment?‚Äù

###  Confirmation Prompt (Optional) 
- You can enable confirmation before fulfillment:

   - Prompt:
     ‚ÄúJust to confirm, you want to book a {AppointmentType} appointment on {Date} at {Time}, right?‚Äù

- Decline response:
   ‚ÄúOkay, I‚Äôve canceled the appointment request.‚Äù

## Step 4: Test Your AppointmentBot
**A. Build the Bot**
- In the Lex V2 console, click your bot: AppointmentBot

- Go to the "Build" tab at the top right.

- Click ‚ÄúBuild‚Äù to compile your bot and intents.

   - This may take a minute or two.
     
**B. Test in the Console**

- Once the build is complete, go to the ‚ÄúTest‚Äù window (on the right side)

- Try typing phrases like:

   - ‚ÄúI need to book an appointment‚Äù

   - ‚ÄúBook a dentist appointment for Friday at 2 PM‚Äù

**The bot should:**

- Prompt for any missing slots ( time or type)

- Confirm the details

- (If configured) simulate fulfillment

## What we Learned
- Building conversational interfaces using Amazon Lex
- Slot management and custom slot types
- Designing user-friendly prompts and confirmations
- (Optional) Integrating Lex with AWS Lambda for dynamic fulfillment

---

##  Status

   - Bot is fully functional and tested with Lex V2.  
‚öôÔ∏è Optional: Can be enhanced with calendar integration or backend database (e.g., DynamoDB) for storing appointments.

## Conclusion
This project showcases a simple appointment booking chatbot using Amazon Lex V2 with Lambda fulfillment. It collects appointment details like type, date, and time, then confirms the booking using a Lambda function ‚Äî demonstrating how to build smart, conversational interfaces on AWS.
